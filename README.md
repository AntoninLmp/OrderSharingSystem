![schema1](/assets/schema1.png)

As you can see the project is using newer technologies such as NestJS and Typescript thus it can be easily scaled depending on numerous parameters. If we deployed this project in production, we would have followed the DevOps course and used Docker with Kubernetes. It would have allowed us add a load balancer and/or replicas depending on the number of requests or the time of the day. This way, we ensure a consistent uptime with good latency for our customers.
